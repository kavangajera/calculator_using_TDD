# ðŸ§® String Calculator â€“ TDD Kata in Python - Using CI/CD pipeline

This is a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** implementation of the classic [String Calculator Kata](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1) using **Python 3**, `unittest`, and **GitHub Actions for CI/CD**.  
It includes 21+ unit tests and a **fully working pipeline to ensure clean, tested code is pushed into the main branch**.
